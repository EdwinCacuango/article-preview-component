## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add and change styles withe JS. It's so simple, but I always was afraid of used it :(


```js
shareBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  authorSection.classList.toggle("active") 
});
```


### Continued development

I have a big problem with the shared box above the arrow. How to position it was so dificult, and the final result it's not responsive. Let me khow how to fixed that!
